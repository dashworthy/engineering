/**
 * Semantic accent roles ShadCN's slate palette doesn't carry — layered on top of `SHADCN` to give
 * callouts, section eyebrows, key boxes, and inline highlights a colored identity again. Every value
 * is drawn straight from Tailwind's own default color scales (blue / emerald / amber / red), never
 * a bespoke hue, so the accent stays inside the Tailwind palette.
 *
 * Each role is `{ ink, soft }` with an optional `fill`, theme-swapped: `ink` is the saturated
 * mid-tone for text, a left accent bar, or a border (Tailwind's 600 in light, 400 in dark — legible
 * on both the page and its own soft fill); `soft` is the pale tinted surface behind it (blue's 50
 * in light, the 950 tint in dark, so it never glares on the near-black ground the way a fixed light
 * tint would) — it backs the KeyBox and Phase panels.
 *
 * `fill` is the card footer band tint, tuned per ground. In light it is a soft blue-100 — a gentle
 * step above the pale blue-50 panels, so the footer still reads as its own band. In dark it matches
 * `soft`, the blue-950 panels, so the footer sits quiet against the near-black card and stands apart
 * only by its divider (a dashed vs. solid top border). It stays a separate token from `soft`
 * precisely so the footer can diverge from the panels per theme like this. Only `brand` carries
 * `fill` today.
